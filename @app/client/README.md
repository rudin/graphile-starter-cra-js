# @app/client

This is the React frontend of the application, bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## GraphQL files

We've separated the GraphQL queries, mutations, subscriptions and fragments into
`.graphql` files inside the `src/graphql` folder. These are scanned and code
generated by [@app/graphql](../graphql/README.md), so that we can then import
them by name, for example:

```ts
import { useAddEmailMutation } from "@app/graphql"
```

`graphql-code-generator`, used in `@app/graphql`, automatically builds hooks
like `use*Query`, `use*Mutation` and `use*Query` so we do not include `Query`,
`Mutation` or `Subscription` in our operation names.

### GraphQL naming conventions

1. Operations are named in PascalCase
1. Name the file after the operation or fragment (e.g.
   `fragment EmailsForm_User {...}` would be in a file called
   `EmailsForm_User.graphql`)
1. Do not add `Query`, `Mutation` or `Subscription` suffixes to operations
1. Do not add `Fragment` suffix to fragments
1. Operations (i.e. non-fragments) should never contain an underscore in their
   name - underscores are reserved for fragments.
1. Fragments should always contain exactly one underscore, see fragment naming
   below

### GraphQL fragment naming

Fragments belong to components (or functions) to enable GraphQL composition.
This is one of the most powerful and most important features about doing GraphQL
right - it helps to ensure that you only ask the server for data you actually
need (and allows composing these data requirements between multiple components
for greater efficiency).

Fragments are named according to the following pattern:

```
[ComponentName]_[Distinguisher?][Type]
```

1. `ComponentName` - the name of the React component (or possibly function) that
   owns this fragment.
2. `_` - an underscore
3. `Distinguisher?` - an optional piece of text if this component includes
   multiple fragments that are valid on the same `Type`
4. `Type` - the GraphQL type name upon which this fragment is valid.

For example:

```graphql
fragment EmailsForm_User on User {
  ...
}
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3007](http://localhost:3007) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br /> See the section
about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.
